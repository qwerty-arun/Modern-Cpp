# ADVANTAGES

- Takes Generic Programming to the next level
- Provides in built DSA

# What is Generic Programming?

- Data types are not specified at the time of implementation of code logic.
- Run time Polymorphism

## 4 Sectors

- Iterators: Loop them (like vectors)
- Functors: Manage State, parameterized
- Algorithms: Search, Sort
- Containers: implementation of well defined data structurr

## Containers

- Sequence types: Vectors, list, deques, stacks, queues
- Associative types: Set, multisets, maps, multimaps (binary trees)
- Unordered Associative types: Set, multisets, maps, multimaps (hash maps)
