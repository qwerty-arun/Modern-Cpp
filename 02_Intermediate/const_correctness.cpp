/*
Const-Correctness
Using const in this way enforces good coding practices (known as "const-correctness"), helping prevent accidental modification of objects and making interfaces safer and clearer. Functions marked const can only call other const member functions.

What const Does in Member Functions?

- Placing const after the parameter list in a member function signifies that the function is "read-only" with respect to the class instance: it cannot alter any (non-mutable) member variables of the class.â€‹

- This enables the function to be safely called on const instances of the class, as it guarantees the object's state will not change.
